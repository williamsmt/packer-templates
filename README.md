# packer-templates

Templates contained in this repository can be used for imaging hybrid cloud instances to run various workloads. The main template json files are located in the root, with dependent variable and configuration files in their respective subdirectories. At a high level, the following must be accomplished prior to deploying a template from this repo:

- Create a .secrets file to hold your CSP credentials
- Download template dependencies (e.g. Ansible Playbooks)
- Amend configuration file variables to desired values
- Run `packer build` to begin deployment process

## Using this repository

Simply clone the repository and start modifying files according to your needs.

```
git clone https://github.com/williamsmt/packer-templates.git packer-templates/
```

Prerequisites:
- Network configuration assumes DHCP is provided to guest
- Connectivity from packer client to Cloud Service Provider API
- Ansible and its dependencies must be installed (if using Ansible provisioner)

### Supported Operating Systems

- [x] Ubuntu Server >= 18.04 LTS
- [x] CentOS >= 7
- [ ] CentOS Stream
- [x] Windows Server >= 2016

### Supported Builders

- [x] vsphere-iso
- [ ] vmware-iso
- [ ] Google Cloud
- [ ] Amazon EC2
- [ ] Azure
- [ ] DigitalOcean
- [ ] Vagrant

## Usage

Most templates in this repository contain dependent provisioners that must be available prior to deployment, e.g. Ansible playbooks and roles. The included Makefile provides a convenient mechanism to automate this requirement as exampled below. Variables used in the Ansible provisioner are available in the various var files contained in the vars directory, and will be passed thru as command line --extra-vars to invoke precedence.

The following command block outlines the Makefile structure that clones an Ansible repo dependency for the included Packer templates:

```
install-ansible-playbook:
	git clone git@github.com:williamsmt/ansible-playbooks.git
```

Invoking this block is as simple as `make install-ansible-playbook` from within the packer-template directory, but largely unnecessary unless you are reviewing the provisioner details.

Additionally, Windows templates deployed with the `vsphere-iso` builder require the OS `.iso` and the VMware Tools `.iso` to be available on a datastore or vCenter Content Library prior to build. They will each be mounted as `.iso` files to the guest for installation.

### Independent Run

Make any necessary variable changes within the template and the installed dependencies (see below configuration file table). Once satisfied with defined settings to be applied, templates can be deployed as documented below.

Copy `secrets.example` to `.secrets` and update the variables with corresponding values for CSP authentication. Example `.secrets` for VMware vSphere:

```
VSPHERE_USER=administrator@vsphere.local
VSPHERE_PASS=Password123!
VSPHERE_URL=vcenter.domain.local
```

**Note:** As previously mentioned, Windows templates must have access to the OS and VMware Tools `.iso` files prior to running a build.

Confirm you are satisfied with the customization to the relevant configuration files identified below, then deploy the template using the Makefile:

`make packer-build-ubuntu1804-vmware`
